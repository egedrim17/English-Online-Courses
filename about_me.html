	<p class="about"><br><i>My name is Evelina Gedrimaite and here is my story.</i><br/>
	
	<br>One year before entering the university I was a regular teenager studying in a regular Russian school. I barely spoke any English. My grammar skills were below the average as well. However, once I decided to study at LCC International University and it motivated me to improve my English so I started working on it very hard. In less than 6 month I passed TOEFL exam and got accepted to LCC International Univeristy located in Klaipeda, Lithuania. </br>
	
	<br>Right now I am a third year student of LCC International University, Comtemporary Communication Major.</br>

	<br>Within these 3 years I have visited 3 continents:<b> Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, Poland and France), North America (USA) and Africa (Tanzania)</b></br>
	<br>Moreover, I had the opportunity to visit London once again and spend 3 monthes living and working in there (summer 2018). Also, I during the summer 2019 I participated in "Work and Travel" program visiting the United States, New York state.</br>
		
	<br> Knowledge of English turned my life over and opened new horizons for me. It became much more easier to travel and to communicate with different cultures getting some new knowledge. </br></p>
